## Highlights
  * You download all your games only the first time. Next time, you will only download the recent ones.
  * There is no special processing step: going from black to white, or from one player to the other is instant.
  * You can explore the openings of a group of players.
  * When you select a player, only the time controls relevant to this player are displayed.
  * You can paste your opening PGN and skip the first moves of book openings.
  * You can download the recent games of all your favourite players in one command.
  * You can scan the selected games to know if they have reached a specific position (FEN)
  * When there is only one result for the next move of the opening, you can replay the game locally or go to the site where the game was played.

## This tool needs a Mongo database to cache your data
  * Either install [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
  * Or create a MongoDB cluster online (there are some free plans, for example: [MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/))
